Here's a detailed description you could use for your GitHub project:
Todo App with Firebase Authentication

This is a Todo App built with React and Firebase that provides users with the ability to manage their tasks securely. Each user can log in, add, edit, complete, and delete their tasks, and all todos are tied to the authenticated user for data privacy.
Features

    User Authentication: Allows users to register, log in, and log out, securely managed through Firebase Authentication.
    Personalized Task Management: Each user’s todos are stored uniquely, so only authenticated users can access their tasks.
    Real-time Updates: Integrated with Firestore for real-time data updates, reflecting todos immediately on the user interface.
    CRUD Functionality: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete capabilities for todos.

Technologies Used

    React: Frontend library for building a dynamic user interface and managing the app state.
    Firebase Authentication: Used to manage user registration, login, and session management.
    Firebase Firestore: Real-time database for storing user-specific todos and handling real-time data updates.
    CSS: Basic styling for an organized, user-friendly layout.

How It Works

    Users register or log in through Firebase Authentication.
    After authentication, users are redirected to the main page where they can add new todos.
    All todo data is stored in Firestore, where each entry is tagged with the user’s unique ID to ensure that todos are only accessible to their respective owners.
    Users can edit, toggle the completion status, or delete tasks as needed.
    When a user logs out, todos are no longer accessible until they log back in.

This project showcases a simple yet functional setup for building a user-authenticated app with persistent, user-specific data.
